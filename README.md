# llmctx

llmctx transforms technical documentation into AI-ready formats. It provides a simple way to access condensed, LLM-friendly versions of popular framework and library documentation through preset URLs. This makes it easier for developers to use AI coding assistants like Cursor or Zed with accurate, up-to-date context from official documentation sources.

- Preset URLs for quick access to LLM-optimized documentation
- Regularly updated content from official documentation

## Supported presets
- Svelte
- SvelteKit

## Feature requests

- [ ] Combine multiple documentation sources (e.g., https://llmctx.com/svelte,sveltekit)
- [ ] Create a "stack" of frequently used frameworks and libraries
- [ ] Implement a checkbox UI for selecting presets and generate custom URLs based on selected documentation
